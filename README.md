# opto
An updated opto provissioning script.
This script does assume the opto has a direct connection to the opto  though. I was also unable to avoid browser macros, and js injection.
<br>Improvements:<br>
<ul>
  <li>doesnt expose the system username and passeword</li>
  <li>finds MAC / hostname on its own</li>
  <li>Runs on Windows</li>
  <li>Fewer dependencies</li>
</ul>


Improvements TODO:
<ul>
   <li>Detect Ethernet PORT name</li>
   <li>select upload based on model name, for example C-series, E-series, or MCP...<br>
      ( For integration into another automation system) <br></li>

</ul>
