interestingly the restore function will set the hostname to the unit which provissioned the original configuration. so for the e360, the RIO hostname will become: opto-05-13-a5
which is the hostname of the RIO which Mike and Dan provissioned long ago.  Device type: GRV-R7-MM1001-10
The hostname for the RIO when the MCP is selected will become: opto-05-12-c1
